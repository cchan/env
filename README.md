# Personal environment setup scripts

```
wget https://clive.io/env && bash env
```

Note that this locks a lot of versions down [CUDA 10.1, conda 2019.10] and is specifically designed to work on Ubuntu 18.04. I suspect it will work fine on 20.04 once CUDA is updated. I don't think it'll work on Debian without some mods.
